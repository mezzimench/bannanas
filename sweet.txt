```
Always remember that with Ubuntu you add the prefix xdg- to the open command "xdg-open" or you get an error like this:
'Couldn't get a file descriptor referring to the console'
When pushing to a different branch than the master branch use:
git push --set-upstream origin foster
#=> Does pull work the same way?
git pull --set-upstream origin foster?

```
